                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Educational Attainment:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The histogram for education may show that a majority of individuals have attained a certain level of education, with the highest frequency concentrated at specific educational years.</li>
                            <li>If the distribution has a peak at lower years of education, it suggests that the population has, on average, lower educational attainment, whereas a peak at higher years would suggest a higher educational level.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Income Distribution:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The income histogram likely depicts the number of individuals within certain income brackets.</li>
                            <li>A higher frequency in lower income categories would indicate that a substantial portion of the population earns less, whereas higher bars in higher income categories would suggest greater affluence.</li>
                            <li>The distribution might also reveal income inequality within the population if certain income brackets have significantly higher counts compared to others.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The heatmap probably shows varying degrees of correlation coefficients between different levels of education and income brackets.</li>
                            <li>Higher positive values indicate a stronger positive association, suggesting that higher educational attainment may correspond to higher income levels.</li>
                            <li>Conversely, lower or negative values would indicate a weaker or inverse relationship.</li>

                    <li><strong>Education Level and Disease Prevalence:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The second heatmap likely reveals the relationship between education levels and the prevalence of certain diseases.</li>
                            <li>This could show whether higher educational attainment is associated with lower prevalence rates for certain diseases, which might imply a link between education and health outcomes due to factors like health literacy and access to healthcare resources.</li>
